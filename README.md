# About me (professionally):
  I give my best to get things done, and to ensure the code I deliver is well thought and readable.\
  When developing UI, i tend to think not only of good layout and reusability, but also focus on proper UX.\
  I'm open minded to other approaches/solutions in regards of solving problems (I know right it's hard to make something perfect, there's always a way to improve smth).\
  Regarding tech stack:\
  I think i'm well experienced in frontend, but I'd love to broaden my views on this matter. But, to get a chance to dive deeper into advanced backend is a thing I would be glad to experience.\
  Besides that, I am well introduced to scrum/agile practices, and have some experience in such workflow (DevHunting, Lesson4Future).\
  

# About me (personally):
I'm passionate about tech industry, history, geopolitics, psychology & philosophy. 
On more casual side: I love gaming, trips with friends, skiing, disputing about philosophical things.

# Education:

- Currently studying Informatyka Stosowana in Kraków on WSEI. 2024 -> now
