# About me (professionally):
  I give my best to get things done, and to ensure the code I deliver is well thought and readable.
  I'm open minded to other approaches/solutions in regards of solving problems (I know right it's hard to make something perfect, there's always a way to improve smth).
  Up to this time, in almost every IT related subject I've worked on in team, I've been able to share my own observations on the matter.
  I'm well introduced to scrum/agile practices, and have some experience in such workflow.

# About me (personally):

I'm passionate about tech industry, history, geopolitics, psychology, philosophy (although these 2 i mainly confront with my experience/views). On more casual side: I love gaming, trips with friends, skiing, disputing about philosophical things.

- IT Technician in Zespół Szkół im. Bohaterów Westerplatte - Jabłonka (2019/2023) 
- Planning this year: IT studies in Kraków/Kielce.
